Please note your changes with your name here!!! Keep newer versions at the top.

To make versions numbers easier:
-Add 00.01.000 to number for an update that implements any new features
-Add 00.00.001 if its just tweaks and bug fixes
-Unless we make a GUI or something that completely changes the program like that, then it will always remain Version 1.*
