Bugs:
-Enemies possibly learn attacks one level to late (Found by Patrick)
-Can have a battle followed immediately by an event when checking the menu (Not consistent, possibly
fixed) (Found by Patrick)
-Trying to make levels an integer just breaks stuff
-Trying to put different kinds of items in different packages breaks stuff
-Prompted to enter dungeons until you stop entering them (Possibly, they like appearing in groups of 3)
-The weakest enemies still cannot hurt you if you get the strongest armor for your level. They are also really easy to defeat
-You can get negative amounts of items after buying them (This may be in general from buying items)

Ideas:
-Power ups/better weapons and armor
-Background music
-GUI?!?! (Maybe, no, probably not)
-Time cycle
-Other Players?
