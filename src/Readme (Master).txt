To-do (overall):

To-do aka ? (In order of priority(sort of)):
    Partially Implemented:
        -Pets taking damage (some attacks could have splash damage) and fainting
        -Pet snacks
        -Having multiple pets
        -Some sort of randomization to pets stats
        -Saving/Loading Pets
        -Being pushed to previous position in board mode
        -Add enemy attack power modifier based on difficulty
        -Add generation of a new board when requirements are met
        -Add saving and loading boards in board mode
        -Rework things with a random chance by using global variables for easier access
        -Reworking of stats (using a base player and multipliers maybe)
        -More Player Classes
        -More enemies
        -More Pets
        -Greater village functionality (options for places to go, towns contaning certain buildings, talking to people,
        companions???)
        -Boards having specific biomes

    No Current Implementation:
        -Custom mode
        -Add more events (enemy kingdoms, strongholds, mountains, valleys, fields, caves, fortress)
        -Story mode
        -Add dungeon bosses
        -Add more to dungeons
        -More items (stat boost potions)
        -Attack types
        -Ability to miss an attack
        -GUI
        -Speed boost item
        -Mana boost item
        -Exp boost item
        -Gold boost item

Bugs:
-Enemies possibly learn attacks one level to late (Found by Patrick)
-Can have a battle followed immediately by an event when checking the menu (Not consistent, possibly
fixed) (Found by Patrick)
-Trying to make levels an integer just breaks stuff
-Trying to put different kinds of items in different packages breaks stuff
-Prompted to enter dungeons until you stop entering them (Possibly, they like appearing in groups of 3)
-The weakest enemies still cannot hurt you if you get the strongest armor for your level. They are also really easy to defeat
-You can find equipment when running from a battle

Ideas:
-Background music
-GUI?!?! (Maybe, no, probably not)
-Time cycle
-Other Players?
