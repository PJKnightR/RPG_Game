-Implement base battle class (Patrick & TJ)
-Implement base actor class (Nathan)
-Implement base player class (Nathan)
-Add different enemies (Paul)

    attacks (mana system), attacks stored in different classes, attacks implemented like pokemon program (Patrick & TJ)

-Add different player classes (Knight, Archer, Wizard)
-Add Critical Hits

    modifier can be used)
