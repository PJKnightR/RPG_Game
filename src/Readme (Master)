To-do (overall):
-Start
-?
-Finish
-Profit$$$
-Microtransactions
-DLC
-Actually finish

To-do aka ? (In order of priority(sort of)):
-Implement base game, main, and module class (initiate battles against enemy) (Kellan)
-Implementing attacks (Different attack for each class, power modifier, arraylist of known attacks, a reason to use all
    attacks (mana system), attacks stored in different classes, attacks implemented like pokemon program (Patrick & TJ)
-Tweaks to enemies (Paul)
-Add different in-game events (Kellan)
-Add moves on level up (Patrick)
-Rebalancing and bug fixes (Patrick)

Bugs:
-Items display a lot of extra text when multiple are added at the same time (Found by Patrick, not nessecary to fix)
-Entering an invalid move and then a valid move causes a crash, referencing the line where mana is calculated. When a move
is entered, it will always use the first number entered (Found by Patrick)


Ideas:
-Implementing equipment (equipment slots in player, stats recalculated when put on or off, a very simple equipment
     modifier can be used)
-Able to do more then just fight enemies with game class (find towns, shops, dungeons, spikepits, enemy kingdoms???, ect)
-Pets
-Item Shop
-Power ups/better weapons and armor
-Background music
-GUI?!?! (Maybe, no, probably not)
-Damage types
-Missed attacks
-Time cycle
-Bosses
-Other Players?


Other Enemy ideas (By Patrick)
- Thief/Bandit
- Zombie/Undead/Husk
- Mummy
- Wraith/Ghost
- A joke enemy/easter egg (Long Slime)
- Barbarian/Viking
