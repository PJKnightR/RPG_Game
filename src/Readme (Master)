Player Classes and Attacks (Ideas) (I suck at attack names, feel free to add some):

For Sure:
-Knight- Attack, Defense, Speed, and Mana pretty balanced
    -Sword Slash, Blunt Strike, Risky Lunge, Kings Beam
-Archer- Attack and Mana average, speed higher, defense lower
    -Arrow Volley, Flaming Arrows, Piercing Shots, Storm of Arrows
-Wizard- Defense Average, Attack and Mana Higher, speed lower
    -Fireball, Finger Lightening, Plasma Strike, Triple-Element Blast

Other Ideas (By Patrick)
-Gladiator aka a Tank- High Attack and defense, god-awful speed, meh mana
-Hunter- High attack and speed, low defense and mana
-Paladin- Amazing attack, meh defense and mana, low speed
-Ninja/Stealth- Amazing speed, high attack, sucky defense, meh mana
