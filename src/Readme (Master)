To-do (overall):
-Start
-?
-Finish
-Profit$$$
-Microtransactions
-DLC
-Actually finish

To-do aka ? (In order of priority(sort of)):
-Implement base game, main, and module class (initiate battles against enemy) (Kellan)
-Finish base battle class (in regards how the battle ends and item usage)  (Patrick & TJ)
-Implementing attacks (Different attack for each class, power modifier, arraylist of known attacks, a reason to use all
    attacks (mana system), attacks stored in different classes, attacks implemented like pokemon program (Patrick & TJ)
-Add different player classes (Knight, Archer, Wizard) (Nathan)
-Tweaks to enemies (Paul)
-Add different in-game events (Kellan)
-Add ability to gain experience and level up (TJ)
-Add basic, consumable items (Patrick)
-Add moves on level up

-Implementing equipment (equipment slots in player, stats recalculated when put on or off, a very simple equipment
    modifier can be used)

Bugs:
-Crashing enemies when the player levels up
-Items display a lot of extra text when multiple are added at the same time


Ideas:
-Able to do more then just fight enemies with game class (find towns, shops, dungeons, spikepits, enemy kingdoms???, ect)
-Pets
-Item Shop
-Power ups/better weapons and armor
-Background music
-GUI?!?! (Maybe, no, probably not)
-Damage types
-Randomize Enemy stats
-Missed attacks
-Time cycle
-Bosses
-Other Players?

For Shizzle:
-Knight- Attack, Defense, Speed, and Mana pretty balanced
    -Sword Slash, Blunt Strike, Risky Lunge, Kings Beam

    -Arrow Volley, Flaming Arrows, Piercing Shots, Storm of Arrows
-Wizard- Defense Average, Attack and Mana Higher, speed lower
    -attack.Fireball, Finger Lightening, Plasma Strike, Triple-Element Blast

Other Ideas (By Patrick)
-Gladiator aka a Tank- High Attack and defense, god-awful speed, meh mana
-Hunter- High attack and speed, low defense and mana
-Paladin- Amazing attack, meh defense and mana, low speed
-Ninja/Stealth- Amazing speed, high attack, sucky defense, meh mana
